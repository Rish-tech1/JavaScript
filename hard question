Find all pairs in an array of integers whose sum is equal to a given number

Return: array â€” matching pairs or empty arrays.

To simplify, the input array will not have duplicates. However, there will be negative and positive numbers. For the solution, like before, I will use a lookup hash. As you can see, knowing how to use a lookup hash, which has constant lookup time, can be very useful.

let arr = [1,5,6,1,0,1];
const findSumPairs = (arr, value) => {
  let sumsLookup = {};
  let output = [];
  
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let targetVal = value - arr[i];
    
    if(sumsLookup[targetVal]) {
      output.push([arr[i], targetVal]);
    }  
    
    sumsLookup[arr[i]] = true;
  }
  
  return output;
}
console.log(findSumPairs(arr, 6));
Conclusion
The above solutions show how you can use simple concepts to solve many common array problems with one pass, linear solutions.
